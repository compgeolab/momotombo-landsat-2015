# Plot Landsat 8 scenes of the Momotombo 2015 eruption

Download some selected Landsat 8 scenes that show the state of the eruption and
make plots to show what's going on.
Uses [xlandsat](https://www.compgeolab.org/xlandsat) to load the scenes and
make composites.

The scenes were downloaded from [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)
and archived on figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21931089
